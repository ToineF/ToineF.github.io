          <h2>The project</h2>
          <p>
            It was <u>a normal day of work for John.</u> Everything was going as usual.
            <br>But then... <u>A goose appeared.</u>
            <br>The company policy was clear : <u>No birds in the office!</u>
          </p>
          <div class="container"><iframe width="840" height="430" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m3UIlWaF1IY"></iframe>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
            This was a <u>1 month project</u> loosely inspired by the game <u>Vampire Survivors</u>, made in <u>a team of 2</u>.
            <br>We wanted to have fun with this project, make something hysterical, and a ton of birds invading an office building seemed funny to us.
            <br>
            <br><u>Team:</u>
            <br><u>Gaëlle Becel</u> - 2D/3D Art, VFX
            <br><u>Antoine Foucault</u> - Programming, Ragdoll, Level Design, Sound Design, Trailer
          </p>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            Since our main goal with this project was to have a <u>funny game</u>, everything we did needed to go in that direction.
            <br>Since we were only two on the team we each had to wear different hats. My main tasks were programming and level design.
            <br><u>Level Designer :</u> I made tight levels, with a lot of props with physics to make armies of birds coming to chase the player really chaotic and funny.
            <br><u>Programmer :</u> <u>Ragdolls</u> were a must to us, so it was my absolute priority to work on that.
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Ragdolls</h2>
          <p>To properly use ragdolls in our game, I needed to work on two aspects:
            <ul>
              <li>Limiting the ragdoll to the visual of the player, and have no effect on their movement, nor making the game collisions bug.</li>
              <p>This one was pretty simple, I just needed to make sure to lock the ragdoll spine to the player's center, and properly set up the Physics Matrix.</p>
              <li>Making a <u>tool to easily make animated ragdolls</u>.</li>
              <p>First, I made an an animated ragdoll with a placeholder model.
                <br>To do that, I have two models, one with the animations (which can be hidden), and the other which takes the rotations of the joints of the animated model, while keeping the ragdoll physics.
            </ul>
          </p>
          <div class="container">
            <video controls playsinline autoplay muted loop>
              <source src="../videos/no_birds_in_the_office_ragdoll_movement.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video> 
          </div>
          <p class="center">(On the left, the animated ragdoll, and on the right the original animated model)</p>
            <div class="container">
              <video controls playsinline autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="../videos/no_birds_in_the_office_ragdoll_animated.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
              </video> 
            </div>
            <p>This worked great for what we wanted, but the process of making it was too long, and needed to be <u>automated</u>, especially since we had multiple characters to ragdoll.
             The goal was to build a tool that could easily go from the Unity default ragdoll with character joints to an animted one, like I had made with the placeholder asset.
              <br>I spent some time on this tool, to ensure it was <u>easy of use</u> (only a few references to make and a button to click) and <u>reusable for other projects</u>.
              <br>And this time was spend very well, as it made us gain a lot of time in the end.</p>

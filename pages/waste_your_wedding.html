          <h2>The project</h2>
          <p>
            A hungry woman wanders in a wedding venue to eat a gigantic cake.
            <br>But can she stop her suitors from marrying her along the way?
            <br>A light-hearted adventure starts!

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
            Used to game jams and short projects, I wanted to challenge myself with a longer solo project and a larger scope.
            I set myself a <b>3-month</b> time limit, working only in my spare time while also doing an internship (so about 3-4 weeks of effective work).
            <br>My goal was to have <b>30 to 60 minutes of high-quality gameplay</b>, to <b>make everything by myself</b>, and, most importantly, to <b>see the project through</b>.
            <br><br>This postmortem covers what went right, what went wrong, and what I learned along the way.
          </p>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>
           <h2>Rushing the concept</h2>
          <p>
                My first mistake was rushing the concept. I chose a unique theme (weddings) which I don’t often see in games, especially for a gameplay-heavy game, but I jumped straight into development at the expense of properly defining the project’s pillars and intentions.
                <br>A week later, I had a working prototype, but the gameplay wasn’t fun and the direction was unclear. I spent valuable time trying to figure out what the game was supposed to be. Eventually, I managed to bounce back by reevaluating my intentions and by prototyping more gameplay, which I'm happy about now.
                <div class="center">
                  <img src="../images/wyw_main_mechanic_gif.gif" alt="" class="image" />
                </div>
                <p class="center"><i>The final main mechanic: gaining an additional jump when hitting something, for aerial gameplay</i></p>
                <br><i><u>What I learned:</u> The beginning was tough because I had to find a fun idea from scratch. To gain some time, <b>I started a game idea bank</b> where I keep my concepts, making it easier to pick one when I’m ready for a big project. And most importantly, I relearned the hard way how crucial it is to <b>establish strong pillars and intentions</b> early on to guide every major decision throughout development.</i>
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Choosing the right Art Direction</h2>
          <p>
            I like to resolve key aspects early on to avoid doubts later in development, and art direction was no exception. This animated mockup was the first thing I created:
          </p>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="../images/wyw_first_gif.gif" alt="" class="image" />
          </div>
          <p>With just this, I could better visualize the game’s feel, colors, characters, and scale. I also decided to limit the color palette to just five colors for the entire game, which helped streamline the process. I kept the environment simple to maintain clarity but focused on lively animations.
            <div class="center">
              <img src="../images/wyw_palette.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            <p class="center"><i>The final color palette</i></p>
            <i><u>What I learned:</u> Looking back, the <b>color limitation</b> was one of the <b>best decisions</b>. While it was challenging to make key elements pop, it allowed me to iterate quickly and stopped me from obsessing over colors. Plus, it created a unique visual style that set the game apart from other pixel art games.</i>
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Developing a scalable game</h2>
          <p>
            For this longer project, I focused on building scalable systems. I aimed to keep the code as generic as possible, relying heavily on a simple OOP principle: <b>composition</b>.
          </p>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="../images/wyw_prefab_orga.png" alt="" class="image" />
          </div>
          <p class="center"><i>The structure for an enemy object, with several components attached (in red)</i></p>
          <p>For example, each enemy had separate scripts for specific functions like health, movement, shooting, and animation. By using composition, I could attach small, independent scripts to objects without dependencies. This allowed me to quickly prototype and iterate on features, since the code was reusable and flexible.
            <br><br>
            <i><u>What I learned:</u> As always, <b>reusing code</b> saved me the most time during development. And by <b>keeping my scripts generic</b>, I’ve built an even larger library of reusable code for future projects!</i>
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>The problematics of a larger project</h2>
          <p>
            One of my goals was to have <b>at least 30 minutes of gameplay</b>, which was a first for me as a solo developer. Creating the content for that length wasn’t the hard part, but I definitely underestimated the effort required to elevate such a large amount of content to a high level of quality. The level art, in particular, took much longer than I expected, even with the minimalist style.
          <br><br>
            <i><u>What I learned:</u> The more content a game has, the more work it takes to maintain quality. That said, I’m proud I avoided the common pitfall of overscoping in terms of quantity.</i>
          </p>
          <br><br><br>
          
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              This development was a ride, but I learned a lot and <b>I'm proud to have seen it through to the end</b>. Being a solo dev gave me freedom to make creative decisions and learn new skills (like shaders and music), but it also made everything more time-consuming.
              <br>Even though I started off on the wrong foot by not clearly defining my intentions, the development remained steady, and I made consistent progress every day, even with limited time.
              <br><br>It wasn’t the easiest production I’ve worked on, but <b>I’d gladly do it again!</b> The final game is available on <a href="https://antoine-foucault.itch.io/waste-your-wedding" target="”_blank”">itch.io</a>.

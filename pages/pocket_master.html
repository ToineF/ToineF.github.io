          <h2>The project</h2>
          <p>
            As the <b>Pocket Master</b>, your job is to help people in need.
            <br>Use your <b>magical pocket</b> to <b>change objects size</b> and please everyone!
            <br>Pocket everything! Objects, people, entire rooms... The pocket world has no limit.
          </p>

          </div>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
            This was a <b>5 days long</b> game jam for the <b>GMTK Game Jam 2024</b> under the theme <b>Built to Scale</b>, made by myself.
            I made a <b>2D puzzle game</b> about putting things in your pocket, and with the ability to swap the size of two elements.
            <br>
          </p>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
          <p>
            My process when finding ideas for game jams is very simple.
            <br>I throw out as many ideas and words as possible, to have a large quantity of ideas. 
            <br>Then I select with few favorites with 3 criterias:
            <ul>
              <li><u>Motivation</u> : How much the idea excites me.
              <li><u>Scope</u> : It must be feasible without crunching.
              <li><u>Challenge</u> : I want to learn new things with each projects.
            </ul>
            <br>I develop the ones I selected.
            <br>I then chose my favorite among them : That's my concept!
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Organisation</h2>
          <p>
            It's really important to me to stay organised when working, with priorities and deadlines.
            <br>For this project, I used Milanote to keep track of everything (Todo lists, references, sketches).
          </p>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="../images/pocket_master_milanote.png" alt="" class="image" />
          </div>
          <br><br><br>

          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <p>
              The first day of the jam was dedicated to brainstorming, planning and prototyping.
              <br>Visually, I wanted to try something other than pixel art, but since my first test took me too long and was not as pretty as I hoped, I finally went to pixel art, still challenging myself by learning Aseprite during the jam.
              <br>I made a quick mockup to quickly define what a screen of the game could look like.
          </p>
              <div class="center">
                <img src="../images/pocket_master_first_art_test.png" alt="" class="image" />

              <img src="../images/pocket_master_mockup.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            <p>But since I went with pixel art, another problem arose : Scaling.
              <br>My game mechanic is about scaling things, and you definitively shouldn't scale pixel art.
              <br>The simple solution : Make more assets.
              <br>Since the art style allowed me to quickly create assets, it was a perfect solution.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <img src="../images/pocket_master_pixel_art.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            <p>Finally, I programmed a simple technical prototype by importing a drag 'n drop system I already made for another project.
              <br>It's important to me to make reusable code, so I can gain time where I need it.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

          <h2>Day 2</h2>
          <p>
              The second day of the jam was dedicated to taking the visual and technical prototype further.
              <br>I made the most important assets in the game, and had a playable game loop at the end of the day, with 2 puzzles to showcase the main mechanic.
              <br>The only things left at this point is to make more content, and to polish everything.
              <br>
              <br>That day, I made a scalable way to make more puzzles, with data contained as scriptable objects.
              <br>I used <b>Odin Inspector</b> to serialize dictionaries, to be able to edit them in the inspector.
              <br>This was useful to assign different sprites for each character or object for different sizes.
              <br>This was also a great way to make more puzzles without writing new code, which made the puzzle design integration process much smoother.
          </p>
              <div class="center">
                <img src="../images/pocket_master_odin.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            <br><br><br>

          <h2>Day 3</h2>
          <p>
              The third day I thought the game missed something.
              <br>I thought the main mechanic could be developped further, so I brainstormed some ideas.
              <br>The main focus of the game, the ability to swap the size of two obejcts was actually was I thought of that day.
              <br>I took to time to make more levels, using that mechanic and realised it was a lot easier for me to have level design ideas.
              <br>So, I shifted to focus of the game to go all out with this mechanic, since it was the things that brought the most fun in the game.
              <br>
              <br>On top of that, I made a cutscene system that day, to give more life to the puzzles by adding narration.
              <div class="center">
                <img src="../images/pocket_master_cutscenes.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
          </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Day 4</h2>
          <p>
              The fourth day was the final day I gave myself the objective to complete the game.
              <br>I made the sound design, and polished what was left.
              <br>I added a tutorial for a better onboarding.
              <br>I made a few more puzzles to have 8 puzzles in total.
              <br>Finally, I published the game on <a href="https://antoine-foucault.itch.io/the-pocket-master">itch.io</a> since I wanted to avoid last-minute bugs or upload issues.
              <div class="center">
                <img src="../images/pocket_master_last_day.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
          </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Day 5</h2>
            <p>
                The final day, I rested.
                <br>I believe it's important to avoid crunch, which is quite frequent during game jams.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In the end, I'm proud of this project, since the game turned out great, and I learned a few things while developing it.
              <br>I generally improved my programming, art and level design skills, while discovering new tools like Aseprite and Odin Inspector.
              <br>I always enjoy game jams, they're a great way to have fun making short games, and to discuss with other creators.
              <br><br>During the jam review period, I got a lot of positive feedback.
              <br><b>The Pocket Master</b> ranked <b>18th</b> out of 7500 games overall. <b>17th</b> in style, <b>53th</b> in creativity, <b>70th</b> in enjoyement.
              <br><br>I'll definitevely take part in more jams!

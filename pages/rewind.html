          <h2>The project</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this project was to make a
            <b>time-rewind mechanic</b> similar to <b>Braid</b>'s, by taking the
            approach to implement this mechanic to an already existing project,
            with a system that isn't designed to support this mechanic. (as if
            it was a special level in the game which is the only one to feature
            this mechanic) <br />After making the mechanic the goal is also to
            research the ways to optimize it to handle as many objects as
            possible at the same time.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I began this project by making research, to find a
            good way to approach time-rewinding, while keeping in mind several
            aspects:
            <ul>
              <li><u>Determinism</u> : Everything should behave the same way every time we rewind time.
              <li><u>Optimisation</u> : The solution should not cause significant performance issues.
              <li><u>Code Structure</u> : Since the system wasn't originally built for this mechanic, the implementation needed to be layered on top of the existing systems without altering them.
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To talk a bit about the structure, the best solution I came across was to <b>record information</b> in an array about every object that could rewind time every frame*.
            <br>This information could be for instance positions, rotations, velocities, color, specific variables...
            <br>Then, when the time rewinds, we go through the array in reverse, applying the contained information to the recorded object, overwriting their values.


            <br><i>* More on recording every frame in the <b>"Going Further"</b> part.</i>
          </p>

          </div>
          <p class="center">A figure of a recorded object, with a position (red) and color (blue), which are stored in an array (purple).</p>
          <p>
            This theoric system is generic enough that it can be applied to most game engines with very little limitations.
            <br>That's why I tried to prototype it using <b>Godot</b>, to prove this point, while studying the differences between Godot and Unity (which I'm more familiar with), especially from an optimisation and code structure standpoint.
          </p>
          <br /><br /><br />

          <h2>Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Another important part of this project was the fact I worked as if the mechanic was not planned from the start in a development standpoint, and needed to be <b>added later in the game</b>, as a secondary mechanic for a specific level.
            <br>This meant <b>decoupling the game logic from the time-rewind logic</b>.
            <br>To set up under these conditions, I used Kenny's 3D Platformer template, to have a base project with a set structure, that allowing me to <b>focus exclusively on the time-rewinding mechanic</b> within certain constraints.
            <div class="center">
              <img src="../images/rewind_kenny.png" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            
            <br>The objective was to add the time-rewinding mechanic to this code, without altering its content nor its structure.
            <br>The natural solution was a simple OOP principle: <b>composition</b>.
            <br>
            <br>I have a base <code>Rewind</code> class which implements some parameters:
            <ul>
              <li><u>Max Positions</u> : The maximum number of recordings in time, if we want to limit it.
              <li><u>Record Frequency</u> : How often we should record.
              <li><u>Rewind Speed</u> : A speed multiplier for timeScale during the rewind.
            </ul>
            <br>This generic class can then be implemented in children classes, which record specific parameters.
            <div class="center">
              <img src="../images/rewind_mechanic_class_explainations.PNG" alt="" class="image" />
            </div>
            <p class="center">Here, the <code>Player Rewind</code> class inherits from <code>Rewind</code> by implementing record and rewind specific behaviours.</p>
            <br>
            Each child class then <b>records a target object's information</b>, without directly modifying its script.
            <br>For instance, the <code>Player Rewind</code> class is able to record information about the <code>Player</code> such as positions, rotations, mesh scale, velocities...
            <br>
            <br>This system allows the <code>Player Rewind</code> to be totally decoupled from the <code>Player</code> class. This means the mechanic is totally dependent on the <code>Player Rewind</code> class.
            <br>Since the system is the same for every objects (falling platforms, coins, moving clouds), it is <b>easy to implement objects that can be rewound</b> (by implementing the <code>Rewind</code> class), but also objects that defy this time-rewind ability <b>and can't be rewound</b> (by simply not implementing any <code>Rewind</code> class on the object).
            <br>This <b>flexible system</b> is a direct benefit of using composition.

          <p>On top of being able to rewind objects, it was important to be able to rewind the <b>music</b>.
          <br>As for the objects, there is a <code>Music Rewinder</code> that follows the same principle.
          <br>Only, instead of recording information, we just play an inverted music, and switch between them at the appropriate time.
          <br>With a bit of <b>reverb</b> with Godot's audio bus system, the music really sells the time-rewinding effect, and makes the mechanic more convincing.

          <h2>Going further</h2>
          <p>
            Making this mechanic is great, but now there are severals important points to consider.
            <br>The first, and the biggest issue is the <b>optimisation</b>.
            <br>For games with few objects in the scene at once, this is fine in itself.
            <br>But as is it, this naive approach could cause performance issue with a lot more objects in the scene.
            <br>There are several ways to easily optimise this mechanic, like by not recording at every frame:
            <ul>
              <li><u>Less frequent recording</u> : We don't need to record every frame. Instead, we can record every other frame and interpolate the values to create the illusion that every frame was recorded.
              <li><u>Recording only when the data changes</u> : Reduce greatly the recording information for objects that don't change or move often.
              <li><u>Recording only deltas</u> : For potential big values such as velocity, we can only record the difference with the last value to record smaller variables.
            </ul>
          </p>

          <div class="center">

          </div>
          <p class="center">Godot's profiler for the naive approach, where the recording doesn't cost much yet compared to other physics tasks.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Another important aspect to consider I presented at the start that I still haven't touched on is <b>determinism</b>.
          <br>It's critical that rewinding doesn't alter how the game plays when time resumes.
          <br>To start with, we can <b>record everything in the physics update</b>, which is frame rate-independant. (<code>FixedUpdate</code> in Unity, <code>_physics_process</code> in Godot)
          <br>If we want to go further, it's important to also keep in mind that moving objects using the physics engine is often not deterministic, so small changes can affect objects' movements. 
          <br>In this case, the provided code was already deterministic, so it wasn't an issue, but it's something to watch out for in more complex scenarios.
        </p>
          <br /><br /><br />
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>To conclude, this project was very informative to me, allowing me to make this mechanic from scratch and to attach it to an existing project.
          <br>Thinking about both the optimisation, determinism and code structure at the same time was a fun challenge too!
          <br>Finally, making this in Godot and comparing it to Unity was educational, allowing me to learn more of the Godot engine (profiler, shader, audio bus...).
          <br>Overall, I'm proud of the result:
